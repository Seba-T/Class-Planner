# Class activities planner

## A responsive, role based web app to better plan and organize group activities in a class.  

The app allows users belonging to the same G suite domain (although multiple domains can be implemented) to reserve a slot for a certain subject on a given day. At times, the amount of available slots on a specific day can be insufficient to accommodate everyone's desire, therefore a <priority> tag has been introduced, allowing the same user to indicate a second and third option in case the first one was unavailable. This way, if multiple users where to book for the same date and subject, possibly outnumbering the available slots, some of them will be rescheduled according to their second and third option. Given that those alternative options have been provided by the users themselves, they should still be happy with their new slots. This solution aims to leave the least amount of people unsatisfied withÂ the way the schedule is organized.
